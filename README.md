> **“Only those who balance light and silence may walk the hidden path.”**
> *Tayrona inscription, City of the Lost*

This small Python game recreates (and re‑skins) the classic **Quarrasi Lock** puzzle from Allen B. Downey’s *Think Like a Programmer*—but relocates the action to the mist‑shrouded **Sierra Nevada de Santa Marta** in Colombia.

We were inspired both by Downey’s book **and** by **Daniel Tam’s** JavaScript adaptation ([danielthetam/TheQuarrasiLock](https://github.com/danielthetam/TheQuarrasiLock)). Our goal is to provide a desktop variant built with **Pygame** that teachers and puzzle lovers can run completely offline.

## Story in a Nutshell

Three ceremonial bars—**Trinos**—inlaid with emerald‑frog gemstones must be slid from the **Right Altar** to the **Left Altar**.

* A light niche turns **ON** when its column holds an **even** number of emeralds.
* A conch horn (the alarm) sounds if an altar ever shows **exactly one** lit niche.
* Pressing a stone **chaguala** silences the horn on the altar you are standing next to, but you can press **only one** chaguala at a time.

Move all three Trinos left without waking the spirits!
